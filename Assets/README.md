# Assets Folder Overview

This folder contains the **core modules and scripts independently developed** by me for the *Unity-Based Racing Simulation Game* project.  
The contents focus on AI pathfinding, vehicle control, and physics optimization.

## ⚙️ Notes
- These files are extracted from the full team project and represent the **modules I personally developed**.  
- Some resources (textures, full models, teammate assets) have been omitted for privacy and size considerations.  
- The demo video illustrating the AI pathfinding feature can be found in the [`/demo`](../demo) folder.
